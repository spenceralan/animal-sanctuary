# Animal Sanctuary
This project will save the world!

Have you ever found yourself running an animal sanctuary and wondering what animals are present? Well here is a tool that will help with all that! With this web app you will be able to add animals as you find them and update them with their handlers and every changing diets!

### Prerequisites
Web browser with ES6 compatibility
Examples: Chrome, Safari
* npm
* bower

### Installing
These instructions have been verified to work on MacOS.
There are a few terminal commands you will need to run to get the app to launch locally on your machine. First though, you will need to clone this repository to your machine and navigate to its folder in your terminal.
Once you have navigated to the correct directory, you will run the following commands:
* bower install
* npm install
* gulp serve
The required packages may take a few minutes to download and install due to the speed of your machine and your Internet connection. The last command should launch the app in your browser! That's it!

## Built With
* Angular

## What I Learned
This week was a whirlwind! A whole new framework but I am getting much more comfortable with the MVC model! I learned that Angular has some great built-in features like *ngIf and [(ngModel)] making responsive web design and updaing objects on the fly much easier.

Future iterations of this app would include an asynchronous database, more robust sorting features, stricter limitations on input, and much much better styling.
